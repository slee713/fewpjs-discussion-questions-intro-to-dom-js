## Exercise: Basic Frontend File Setup

Create the basic frontend file setup in a new folder. You should have:

- an html file `index.html` with a header and a paragraph
- a css file `style.css` with a single rule changing something about the display of the elements
- a js file `index.js` with a single statement logging "Hello, world" to the console
- tags linking the css and the javascript into your html file

Open the index.html file and verify that the CSS and JS are linked to your files and running.
